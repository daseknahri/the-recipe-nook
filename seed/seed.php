 * Recipes site seed — run by docker/site-init.sh via `wp eval-file` on every start.

 * BRAND: the site name/tagline come from content/site-profile.json
 * (brand.name = "The Recipe Nook" since the 2026-11-06 brand pass).
 *
 * Brand facts are read from content/site-profile.json (the ONE config place); the literals
 * below are fallbacks and must stay in sync with that file. A brand change is applied by
 * editing the profile (+ the child theme header) and bumping RC_SEED_VERSION.
 *
 * Idempotent: the brand/site setup runs once per RC_SEED_VERSION, and each article bundle is
 * imported once (tracked in the rc_imported_bundles option), so a restart mid-import resumes.
 * Adapted from the Dales & Cobbles seed (germ self-seeding pattern).
